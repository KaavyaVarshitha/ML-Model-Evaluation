# ML-Model-Evaluation



## EVALUATION OF MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ON WINE QUALITY DATASET

The dataset used for this evaluation is the ‘Wine Quality’ dataset, which contains various chemical properties of red wine. The goal is to predict the quality of the wine, which is a score between 0 to 10. For this, the input variables are fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol using Multiple Linear Regression Model, Polynomial Regression Model, Support Vector Regression Model, Decision Tree, and Random Forest and conclude the best model for this dataset. The metrics used for this model evaluation are R-squared value, mean-squared error, root-mean-squared error, normalized root-mean-squared error, and mean absolute percentage error.
